* About
This is a simple enough repository containing some ~C++~ code and wrappers to
manipulate systems of copper and hydrogen. The focus is on generating data from
~con~ files which can then be visualized in ~R~.
** Usage
For now, it requires a pretty manual build process:
#+begin_src bash
Rscript -e 'library(devtools); devtools::clean_dll(); cpp11::cpp_register(); devtools::document(); devtools::load_all()'
#+end_src
* Developing
** Exports
Rather confusingly (by [[https://github.com/r-lib/cpp11/issues/233][design apparently]]) and unlike ~Rcpp~[fn:whynot], functions are not automatically
exported. They will need an entry in the ~R/pkgname-package.R~ file.

[fn:whynot] Generally much more usable
